# ConsoleTetrisGame
The Tetris Game, that runs right in the console tab in your IDE!

Use keys '←' and '→' to move your figure, key '5' on numpad to 
rotate it, or press Space if you want to make it fall instantly.

Field updates every 0,3 seconds, so the speed of falling figures
is constant!
Press 'q' if you want to exit.

Have fun! =)
